                <p class="u-text u-text-1">To understand cryptocurrency we must first examine blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to securely store data. Blockchain stores information in a system of blocks that are chained together known as a ledger. Each block consists of 3 key elements: <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;-</b>&nbsp; Data: this could be any type of information, in cryptocurrency the data is the details of a transaction <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><b>-</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hash: a function that encrypts the data into a unique code of numbers and letters. <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><b>-</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hash of the previous block: when a new block is added to the chain it records the hash of the previous block to link the blocks together, creating a chain. <br>
                  <br>The hashing function of blockchain is one of three key security features that makes blockchain so secure. Any time the data inside a block is decrypted or changed the hashing function will generate a new unique code and as such, it is no longer recognised as the same block and the chain is broken (as the following block still contains the hash of the now non-existent block). This way it is easy to identify when a block has been tampered with and reject those changes from the network. <br>
                  <br>For added security, a Proof of Work (PoW) system is employed to deliberately delay the creation of new blocks. This delay time varies depending on the type of blockchain, for the Bitcoin blockchain PoW takes 10 minutes. As of 2020 there are over 650,000 blocks in the Bitcoin Blockchain (Conway, L., 2020), so if someone attempted to tamper with a block it could take 6.5 million minutes (or 12 years!) of complex computing to recalculate the PoW for the entire chain. <br>
                  <br>The P2P network is the final line of defence that makes blockchain arguably the most secure technology currently available. Upon joining the network, users are distributed a copy of the entire blockchain, known as a node. When someone creates a new block, it is sent to each node on the network. The nodes then inspect the block for any evidence of tampering, if none are detected the block is verified. The nodes must reach a consensus of more than 50% before the new block can be added to the chain. <br>
                  <br>Blockchain technology remained relatively underutilised until 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto adapted blockchain to develop the world's first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is a digital cash system that allows the trading of currency without having to go through a centralised financial institution. Bitcoin was the original cryptocurrency but as of 2021, there are 4,000 different cryptocurrencies (De Best, R., 2021). <br>
                  <br>Online illicit networks were quick to adopt cryptocurrency as a payment system to protect them against prosecution. The hashing functions that encrypt the data inside a block allows criminals to transfer funds under total anonymity. This anonymity has been vital in the success of dark web sites such as Silk Road, (Ali, M, 2013) and those that have followed in its path, as it makes it virtually impossible for law enforcement to identify the users. As such, cryptocurrency has developed a questionable reputation amongst the general population. <br>Despite the criminal associations, tech savvy investors have recognised the potential value of cryptocurrency and online exchanges, such as Coinbase, have been built to allow users to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Since its inception the value of a single bitcoin has risen from just a few cents to over AUD $70,000 today (Coindesk, N.D). As the market share of cryptocurrency grows into the billions, the huge network of crypto-investors will continue to grow as people try to grow their wealth.

                <p class="u-text u-text-2">Regulation by governments will be required to decriminalise cryptocurrency and enable mainstream adoption. This is a difficult challenge due to the decentralized nature of the technology. Currently, cryptocurrency falls under the umbrella of investments and as such, are subject to income tax upon (ATO, 2020). But, much more work needs to be done. Departments of blockchain specialists will need to be established to consider the role of cryptocurrency in funding terrorism and money laundering and establish regulations to mitigate this risk. Under regulation, law enforcement will have the power to prosecute individuals who are using cryptocurrency to fund crime. <br>
                  <br>Financial institutions risk redundancies if they do not adapt to this emerging technology. Already Australian banks are researching the possible use and implications of cryptocurrency and blockchain (Commonwealth Bank, 2020). While we await their findings, it’s possible to speculate that, at the bare minimum, banks will eventually offer exchange services for cryptocurrency to their customers. Lenders will need to eventually recognise cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset, as crypto-investors apply for loans. Further, the financial advisory sector will need to offer cryptocurrency specific advice to their clients leading to job creation for digital finance specialists. <br>
                  <br>Blockchain technology is not limited to financial trade, in fact we’re already seeing a number of blockchain adaptations being developed across a number of different industries. In electricity, research is being done to develop a distributed smart grid technology to move society into a new age of sustainable electricity with boosted reliability, availability and efficiency (Proctor, D., 2020). The possible role of blockchain in revolutionising democrated elections is currently being researched, though is the topic of heated international debate (Government Technology, 2020). The applications of this technology are seemingly infinite, and as such, the IT industry will see an increasing demand for Blockchain and cryptography experts.&nbsp;<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-3">While I may not be able to buy my groceries with cryptocurrency just yet, it is not a stretch to imagine that one day I could be using cryptocurrency for everything from online shopping to dining out. The recent news that Tesla will now accept bitcoin as a currency for payment (Ferstein, J. 2021) and that Twitter is considering paying employees in bitcoin (Prang, A. 2021) suggests that mainstream adoption may be closer than we expect. Continued reporting of cryptocurrency has led to a rising curiosity for everything crypto amongst my family and friends. <br>
                  <br>This curiosity has fuelled my friends and I to research the possibilities of investing in cryptocurrency. As the value of property continues to rise out of reach, it is evident that full time work alone isn’t enough to land our dream homes. Cryptocurrency shows huge potential to grow our wealth, but it is important to remember that the market is extremely volatile. While yes, it’s possible to make millions investing in crypto, it’s also possible to lose it all overnight (Treanor, J. 2017). Rather placing all our bets in one basket, we have used cryptocurrency as a way to diversify our investment portfolios alongside other traditional assets. If our research serves us well, we will be able to grow our wealth modestly and take control of our financial wellbeing. <br>
                  <br>For my more artistically inclined friends, the development of NFTs, a non-fungible token built on the Ethereum blockchain, poses an exciting new potential revenue stream. NFT tokens contain digital goods in the form of art, animations or video amongst other things. With Grimes making millions on NFTs (Kastrenakes, J. 2021), they are certainly raising some eyebrows and are the cause of contentious debate about what art really is. Nevertheless, it’s certainly an exciting time to get involved with such a rapidly innovating technology as witness how it transforms the world we live in.&nbsp;<br>
