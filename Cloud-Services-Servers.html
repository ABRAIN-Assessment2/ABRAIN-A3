                <p class="u-text u-text-1">Cloud services and servers can essentially be defined as the delivery of computing services like off-site computing solutions, servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence over the Internet also known as the cloud. <br>This mainly exists to store, view and host data to send or receive to and from users. It also exists to provide computing power and cloud memory available as a service. Similar to cloud storage, users can get access to as much or as little capacity as they need. Cloud computing is also able to provide access and solutions to accessing computing resources and applications through a virtual desktop PC or a Cloud PC. <br>The running costs of cloud computing and services are very low because the user would typically only pay for the cloud services that they use, helping lower operating costs of a business or infrastructure more efficiently because the cost would only increase as the business changes its scale and needs. Although cloud computing costs would seem steep from a non-technological standpoint, it is generally considered very low and inexpensive considering the amount of data one can store over the internet and manage/access it anytime, anywhere. <br>
                  <br> A few examples of what can be done and what is possible with today’s technological advancements achieved within the Cloud in general: (Azure.microsoft.com. 2021) <br>Create cloud-native applications - Quickly be able to build, deploy and scale applications native to the cloud technologies and tailored to the UI. <br>Test and build applications - This can help reduce cost and time needed to test and build applications over the internet through cloud. <br>Store, back up and recover data - Data can be saved and protected more cost-efficiently by being able to transfer them to an offsite storage system which is usually accessed anytime anywhere. <br>Stream audio and video - This can give the ability to connect with anyone anywhere through the use of cloud technology with high definition audio and video with the addition of playback by temporary buffer storage. <br>Embed intelligence - Can use intelligent actions and features to help engage customers and audience to provide valuable insights from any captured data. <br>Deliver software on demand - Also known as software as a service (SaaS), this lets anyone or any business to offer the latest software versions and updates around to customers at any time if they need it on-demand, regardless of where they are. <br>
                  <br>In the future, the main improvements or capabilities due to cloud technologies are: (DataFlair. 2021) <br>Cloud resources can be easily obtained very quickly almost always regardless of the constraints whereas it usually takes weeks or months to obtain and allocate the right resources to the right use case or user. <br>Cloud computing is much more efficient than on-premises IT infrastructure in the sense that any and all companies need to quickly develop new products and services, assess their market potential and implement them to stay competitive. <br>Cost efficiency will be a high priority when it comes to a big organization or company especially when operating in a major city. With this emerging technology, the company could lease only the resources that will be needed plus the operating costs which aren’t very high. This makes it predictable for costs related to it hence giving them the ability to analyse the cost efficiency before paying upfront. <br>
                  <br>Cloud storage is made possible by the developments of data servers to connect to and from via the internet, web-based interfaces to be able to access stored data in an intuitive way and/or via a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of access. <br>
                  <br>Any cloud storage system has to include at least one data server that a user can connect to via the internet. <br>The user can then send files manually or automate a process that can be initialised either remotely over the internet or manually to the data server which forwards the information to multiple servers. The stored data can then be accessible through a web-based interface. <br>
                  <br>Usually, most high budget cloud storage systems rely on other replications of the data on the server onto other storage servers for general server redundancy, maintenance, during any data breaches and/or unexpected failures. <br>“For example, the Amazon AWS Cloud spans 55 availability zones in 18 geographic regions at the present time.” (Enterprise Storage Forum. 2021) <br>
                  <br>Although the data in servers or public cloud storages are replicated in different physical locations mainly for redundancy special cases such as fault tolerance, Primary data server accessed over the cloud via the internet are usually located close to or inside the facility or the company accessing it for ease of physical maintenance and faster read and write speeds as the connections don’t have to travel halfway around the globe. <br>The speed difference between a primary server located close to the access point and a secondary server for redundancy, located very far from the access point doesn’t vary too much considering the technological advancements made in the field. (Enterprise Storage Forum. 2021)<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-3">The main impacts due to the development of cloud technologies are: (CloudWATCH. 2021) <br>Drastically lowered costs for maintenance and development as most of it can be done over the internet and updates can be pushed through using the Internet of Things (IoT) automatically. <br>Improved performance can be easily achieved as the company or the user group/organisation as the users won’t be needing their storage drives to run as full usage as it will be running on the server, hence better performance. <br>Instant software updates can be achieved as they can be downloaded and ready to be installed on the server and the user can have access to the new versions without any wait times. <br>Increased data reliability as the data is usually replicated so there is a less chance of losing it and can be restored again. <br>Easier group collaboration can be possible as all the data can be shared and constantly updated live for other users to use and act upon. <br>
                  <br>The main thing cloud systems and technologies can change would be not needing onboard storage solutions and unlimited storage space can be acquired. <br>
                  <br>Employees, companies and organizations will be the ones most affected by the development of this Cloud technology. <br>Employees: They won’t need to have onboard storage on their computer to store company information or files as this can be done off-site in the data servers used for the cloud storage. This reduces companies having to shell out more money to supply their employees with more expensive physical storage devices. <br>Companies: They won’t be needing the infrastructure to produce, build and maintain their storage solutions as this can all be done off-site on the cloud storage systems and software updates, expansion and maintenance can be done without disturbing any of the companies work as the cloud provider usually handles this. Another advantage/effect this could cause is the fact that companies won’t be needing to worry about data redundancy issues and spending more budget on physical storage for each employee. <br>Organizations: They won’t have to worry about data redundancy issues and spending more budget on physical storage for all of the company data and information and for each employee working there. They also won’t be needing the infrastructure to produce, build and maintain their storage solutions as this can all be done off-site on the cloud storage systems and software updates, expansion and maintenance can be done without disturbing any of the companies work as the cloud provider usually handles this. <br>
                  <br>Although cloud technology won’t fully create, replace or make redundant current jobs, it will still have a huge impact. It’s currently common knowledge to know some jobs are going away due to this technology as it emerges. As people adopt cloud computing, most other people will have to prepare for the changes that will likely occur. “When jobs are eliminated through the use of technology, such as cloud computing, new ones typically pop up in one another’s places.” (Linthicum, D., 2021)<br>

This convenience is a major plus point regarding how the technology is developed in the near future. <br>Personal storage can now be worry-free as I wouldn’t have to be worrying about how much storage I have left, as cloud providers such as “dropbox”, “google drive” or “mega” will increase my storage requirements automatically and I will only be charged for what I use. <br>Education is a major difference in my life and most people’s lives too due to cloud technology. These days, especially due to COVID-19, many schools, institutions and organizations are either forced to or required to offer other forms of education. This has led to a worldwide network of new cloud-based online learning systems. This has in turn led to cloud storage becoming so persuasive that most people realise that they’re even using it. <br>
                  <br>There are a few major points that affect members of a family or friends, such as: (Guttman, C., 2021) <br>A majorly emerging video conferencing company called zoom has set its mission to “develop a people-centric cloud service that transforms the real-time collaboration experience and improves the quality and effectiveness of communications forever.” <br>Social media has changed drastically due to the latest developments in cloud technology. Many major social media outlets such as Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram all majorly rely on cloud storage solutions to store all their collected and user published data. This has enabled users to view other users’ posts and engagements at any given point in time as it is all readily accessible made possible by the cloud and its developments in cloud computing too as the whole GUI and applicational requirements and works are based on working in the cloud using its computational power to run it in the background seamlessly. <br>&nbsp;to day life due to daily/regular usage of cloud technology in my daily life would be:<br>
