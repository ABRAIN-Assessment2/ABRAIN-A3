        <h2 class="u-text u-text-1">So What Will Green Thumb Actually Do?</h2>
          <p>Green Thumb comprises two primary pieces of technology: a soil probe and a phone app. These technologies work together to assist plant growers in tracking and maintaining plant health. The probe consists of sensors to measure soil nutrition while the app records these measurements, assesses overall plant health and diagnoses plant disease. Combined, this technology serves as a powerful education tool and database for novice and advanced gardeners alike.</p>
          <p>The Green Thumb soil probe is a circuit fitted with sensors to measure the temperature, moisture and pH of a plants’ soil. To collect measurements, the probe is placed directly into the soil of a pot and is triggered by a button on the Green Thumb app to collect measurements. These measurements are transmitted to the app through Wi-Fi and stored in a database. The probe is battery powered and portable so that it can be used to measure soil health in countless pots around the home. The ease of use and portability appeals to a wide market of plant growers while saving them money. The soil probe is the essential tool for this project which gives Green Thumb a competitive advantage against other plant health apps on the market. </p>
          <p>The primary function of the Green Thumb app is a plant health database. Upon signing up, users are prompted to build their first plant profile in the app. They are asked to identify the plant species, if they are unsure, users can scan the plant with their camera and using image recognition, the app will automatically identify the plant type. Once the species is identified, the app will be able to provide specific information and recommend the ideal values for soil health variables measured through the probe. When using the probe, the app will harness AI to determine the health of the plant based on results of the probe measurement. If the plant is classified as unhealthy, the app will be able to determine the cause and provide suggestions to restore the plant back to health.</p>
          <p>Plant profiles store the data received from the soil probe to allow users to look back over historical data and compare variables through helpful infographics that can be viewed over a week, month or annual timeframe. Additionally, users can also upload photos of their plant to its respective profile to track growth and changes in its appearance. Over time, the Green Thumb AI will continually process the probe data to detect patterns and provide users with further advice. For example if the AI detects some gradual changes in soil health due to changing weather, the chat bot would read: “Your soil conditions were ideal in summer, but now that it’s winter the soil temperature is dropping fast. Try placing your plant in a sunnier position during these colder months to keep up the healthy growth!”</p>
          <p>The final innovative function of the Green Thumb app is the powerful diagnosis tool. If a user notices a change in their plant’s appearance and is concerned that their plant has become diseased, they can use this tool to diagnose the disease and learn how to restore their plant. When launching the diagnosis tool, users are instructed to upload photos of the affected area of the plant. These photos are run through Green Thumb’s catalogue of plant disease images to identify possible diagnosis’. Next, the user is required to use the soil probe to take soil readings. The diagnosis tool compares these results to the values set in the plant profile and the images to determine the cause of the disease. For example, if images display white spots on leaves <i>and</i> the soil probe detects high nitrogen levels the diagnosis tool will determine that spider mites are the cause of plant decay. This diagnosis is then stored in the relevant plant profile so users can track their plants journey back to health. Through machine learning Green Thumb’s diagnosis tool will be highly accurate and mitigate the risk of mistreatment.</p>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-1">How Green Thumb Began</h2>
          <p>Bridget, the creative mind behind Green Thumb, has always loved gardening - often getting in trouble from her partner for bringing home yet another plant! When tasked with coming up with a project plan in Assignment 1 she knew she wanted to use technology to make gardening easier but wasn't sure where to start. Below is the process that led to the conception of Green Thumb.</p>
          <img src="images/greenthumborigin.png">
          <p><i>Then along came ABRAIN...</i></p>
          <p>ABRAIN was formed to tackle Assignment 2. Arvee, Nikhil, Idris, Adrian, Renee and Bridget met (somewhat awkwardly) for the first time and each introduced their project ideas to the group. The group decided that we wanted to pursue Green Thumb as their group project for the next 2 assignments as we felt it appealed to a wide audience, solved a real problem and could empower and educate people. Additionally, we were pleased to discover that Nikhil actually had prior engineering experience building circuits with Arduino so this was a significant motivator for our decision as we were confident we could actually build what the project was suggesting.</p>
          <p>As a group, we assessed the Green Thumb project and brainstormed ideas to improve it. The idea felt very large and possibly out of scope for the allowed time in assignment 3 so we decided to reduce some elements of the project and focus our efforts on the more innovative components that make Green Thumb unique and effective. Ultimately, that meant removing the social media functions proposed by Bridget in assignment 1. Of all the components to Green Thumb, the group felt that this was the least essential and that it would strain resources moving into assignment 3. With this refined version of the project, we confidently submitted assignment 2 and eagerly awaited feedback</p>

      <div class="u-clearfix u-sheet u-sheet-1">
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-1">How It Progressed</h2>
          <p>While we awaited our A2 marks, we began exploring how to proceed with this project. We were confident in Nikhil’s ability to lead the circuit side of the project, however we were unsure how to tackle the rest of the tasks. To make the project easier to digest, we broke it down to identify the essential components to create Green Thumb. This was identified as:
            <ul>
              <li>The soil probe</li>
              <li>The app</li>
              <li>The database</li>
              <li>The Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>As Intro to IT students, our programming skills are minimal at best. We knew it would be out of scope to build an entirely functional app with our skills in the assigned time frame so we began brainstorming possible artefacts we could deliver that would demonstrate how Green Thumb will work and make it easier for a more skilled group to take over to and get the app to a marketable state. We decided it was important to develop artefacts for each of the essential components identified above.
            <ul>
              <li>For the soil probe, we decided to produce a working prototype of the circuit along with a schematic to demonstrate how the circuit works. As Nikhil has experience working on these kinds of projects, we assigned this task to him to manage.</li>
              <li>Instead of programming an app (a skill which none of us possess) we decided to utilize prototyping software to design a prototype of the app's user interface. Bridget has experience building website prototypes in Figma so we decided to proceed with this software and she led a small team, consisting of Arvee and Idris, to get this up and running.</li>
              <li>Due to our lack of experience in creating a fully functioning database system, we decided to develop an Entity Relationship diagram that will visually represent the interactions between the differing Green Thumb Databases. We also felt it was important to explore the security measures needed to protect this data. Adrian, our Cyber Security Analyst, was assigned to lead this task with Bridget to assist.</li>
              <li>The AI component of the app felt the most daunting and out of scope. We researched possible ways to develop a prototype for this, but ultimately decided that this would be out of scope for this project. Instead, we decided to develop an AI strategy that would outline the software and data required to build the AI so that future Data Scientists could easily take over the job and use this as a guide to bring Green Thumb to life. Renee is the team member with the most plant knowledge, and a curiosity for AI so we assigned her with this task.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>With these goals set, we got to work developing our artefacts. Not long after, we received our feedback from Assignment 2.  It was suggested that we take a deeper look into tools and skills required for this project would be beneficial as well as an extensive investigation into competing technologies and how Green Thumb will be different. We made it our priority to address these points moving into assignment 3 to ensure we complete this project.</p>
          <p>The best way to understand competing technologies is by using them. We got to work downloading and engaging with popular plant health apps to examine the functionalities and to gather insights to improve Green Thumb. Our findings were summarised in a table to easily compare the functions and tools offered by these popular apps.</p>

          <p>From this market analysis we gained some significant insights. The hidden costs of these apps were a surprise and fuels our motivation to provide an affordable solution for tracking plant health. We decided that the Green Thumb app will be a free to download app with any purchase of the soil probe. We will need to consider the costs associated with running the app and keeping it updated and explore options to generate revenue to support that. Possible revenue streams to keep Green Thumb profitable would be:
            <ul>
              <li>Product purchases - we could develop new soil probes to measure new plant variables and generate revenue through their associated sales</li>
              <li>In-App ads - run discreet advertisements for related gardening products that our users may find of value to generate income without negatively affecting the user experience</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>This will be an important conversation to have with marketing associates and product managers leading up to the launch of Green Thumb to ensure the app is viable and profitable.</p>
          <p>While developing the artefacts, we took the advice of our A2 marker and did a deeper investigation into the tools and skills required for this project. We researched countless technologies to identify the best software and hardware to bring Green Thumb to life as well as understanding the skills required to use this technology. Outlined below is the journey to take each of our artefacts from concept to prototype/proof-of-work.</p>

                <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">The original idea for the probe and its circuit was that we would use an Arduino nano but the team’s lead programmer and developer later found out that using a simple D1 Mini board would turn out to be much simpler as all we needed was for the data to be transmitted to the local network for the app to show the user rather than to store and do anything further to it before sending it via an ESP8266 network module. This drastically reduced the size of the Green Thumb to just a little bigger than a stick of gum. Furthermore, Nikhil also discovered that the DH22 air temperature and humidity sensor/module originally thought to be used could easily be damaged with soil being able to enter its housing either while planting, inserting or watering the plant/pot. So Nikhil found a better solution although it would make the final product a bit bulkier.
The D1 Mini board could then be paired with the prototyping and designing app called Blynk.
The Blynk app receives the values and converts them to digital readable characters from the analogue value if necessary and the developer, Nikhil has made an arrangement of different widgets which are to be dragged and dropped onto the interface.</p>
<p>The group agreed to this new tech but unfortunately, there were delays with shipping. To avoid not having any artefacts for this probe, we created a schematic so we could visualise how the probe would work.</p>
<p>This is the circuit created for the whole product with all the sensors and modules wired together.</p>
<img src="images/schematic.jpeg" alt="" class="center">
<p>The parts finally arrived and we built a working prototype. The main issues we encountered were that two major parts were cancelled by the supplier as they were out of stock. Hence we were unable to source new ones in time for the deadline. This resulted in the prototypes being half-finished but functional for at least one main aspect of it.</p>

                <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">We began by firstly researching several of our competitor’s application interfaces to get design inspiration. We had considered our brand colour (Green Thumb) and its consistency on the page, how many certain plants we have to include for the prototype sample, as well as covering basic UI elements on an application (such as links, page dimensions, and its accessibility). Some examples of design templates we based it from are: </p>
                <img src="images/bunnyears.png" alt="" style="height:525px;">
                <img src="images/unnamed.png" alt="style="height:300px;"">
                <img src="images/unnamed (1).png" alt="style="height:300px;"">
                <p>CContinuing on from our discussion, we thought about  how our competitors do their UI, in particular what they have done very well, as well as what they could have done to improve. Using that information, we made Green Thumb’s different from the rest by creating it with the inspiration from the best parts of our competitor’s UI. For example, one of the competitors is Plantr, but their main flaw is that they have got too many advertisements on their app, and their AI didn’t offer much help outside of identifying species. In addition, they force the user to manually enter watering suggestions and care instructions instead of being automatically included. We made sure that Green Thumb will be an ad-free app, as well as having a considerably advanced AI that can  give consistent data (when the soil probe is used as well). In this way, we are considerably standing out from our competitors. </p>
                <p>Moreover, our group drew up a rough mock up of the customer journey, talking about the further decisions we should make based on previous discussions and considerations when they are implemented.</p>

                <p>Finally, we started creating the interface with Figma. Initially when we created the buttons for the pages, it had a few texts alongside it. However in further contemplation between the team, the buttons have been redesigned. Some of them have a function that would change based on probe readings so we wanted to keep it image based with minimal text. We decided that it's more important to have visualised images instead of having more text. Below Are the examples of this:</p>
                <img src=images/Buttons.png alt="" class="center">
                <p>During the process, however, we did encounter several challenges. They are:
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>The creation itself: </b>he group assigned from this interface (Bridget/Arvee/Idris) aren’t experts and are first-time users. (Though Bridget took the lead with getting everything set up as she has a bit of experience on the interface). The team took a bit of time to learn how to use the application.</li>
                    <li><b>The main interfaces: </b>We needed to make sure our app covers the important interfaces for Green Thumb. Initially, we had several main buttons, such as Plant Profile, Diagnostics, Forums, FAQs, Chatbot, Settings but after further discussion we decided to cut some of these and reduce it to stay more consistent.</li>
                    <li><b>Manipulation and movement of pages: </b>We wanted to make sure the figma prototype works how it's intended, and as if users/testers are looking through our final application. We spent quite a bit of time considering the designated buttons, but we kept on adding and removing features to make sure we didn't add any unnecessary items and preserve content that is related to the criteria. </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Eventually we got to the point where there were functionality flaws in the prototype. We had to do something with the camera because it is complicated to integrate it with figma. In the end however, the team overcame this obstacle by screenshotting an iphone’s camera interface and overlaid our desired images on top of the camera interface area. This way it looked like the app went to the phone’s camera and took an image. Also, we had trouble visualising plant health and history on the app. Though we were able to find a solution for the plant health, it was initially in the form of percentages but the resulting data would be inconsistent. We decided to separate it into 3 parts, soil acidity, temperature and moisture that have visual images representing its current condition (shown above).</p>
                <p>Other changes that we made were (1) adding the settings button. One of our team members, Idris,had suggested if we have an application, there should be a settings page for it, and (2) changed Serial Code to QR Code; as QR code entices the user to use the camera function making it easier to access rather than typing a series of characters and pressing enter.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, even with these challenges and functionality flaws, we were able to implement everything that we originally planned to put in. There was an FAQs page section, though we decided it wasn’t adding value to the app and to the customer experience. The team realised we can do this over the Chatbot interface instead, rather than having a specific page full of dull text this enabled the “FAQ” to be more engaging  and more creative, additionally we were able to utilize figma’s features to our advantage. </p>
                <p><b>Testing phase and feedback: </b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Initially, the photos weren’t showing up. This is because some of them were high resolution and it takes a lot of time until it is fully loaded. There were also a bunch of large files with many assets loading at the same time. In the end, we had to edit those pictures to a lower resolution (but quality is still good) and reduce the large file into separate pages.</li>
                    <li>Improvements made to the prototype after the testing: Just minor adjustments such as making sure the position of textboxes and images doesn’t move page-to-page, and making sure the linking for all pages are accessible so users will know how to get to where they want to go easily.</li>
                  </ul>

                <p class="u-text u-text-3">Green Thumb in essence is a database that tracks plant health. Therefore designing and securing the database is an essential step in working toward the completion of this project. As no members of our team have experience programming databases, we determined that we would craft a concept of our databases and the relationships between them. The first logical step was to work out the types of data we would be collecting.</p>
                <img src="images/databasebrainstorm.png" alt="" class="center">
                <p>Now that we had identified the types of data that Green Thumb will be collecting and classified our entities and attributes, we had to assign our data types and keys. Names and general information are assigned to the data type of varchar and numerical information is assigned to the data type of integer. As for special information that requires decimal points, such as temperature, the data type of double is used.</p>
                <p>Then we defined the relationships between the data in an ER Diagram using Lucidchart. We chose to use Lucidchart as it allowed us to create a diagram of our database without any need for programming. See below.</p>
                <img src="images/ERD.png" alt:"" class="center">
                <p>Although not normally represented within a database ER diagram, we wanted to demonstrate what data the Green Thumb AI would have access to. We felt this was important because the AI needs to have access to all the probe, disease and species data in order to feed the machine learning model and provide users with insights into their long term plant health. Additionally, this data is essential for our chatbot to be able to answer users questions. As such, we created a new frame within the ER diagram to show the type of data that is being accessed and monitored by Green Thumb’s AI. </p>
                <p>When it comes to hosting our secure database and also collecting and storing user information, we looked into online hosting servers such as HostGator or GoDaddy. Both are great options, however, for the time being, the option we will proceed with is to host our own server. This would be logical as we will need to save some resources as a small start up. In the future, it may be necessary to consider outsourcing to services such as HostGator or GoDaddy to avoid maintenance costs, downtime issues such as power failure, essentially making a more efficient and stable server. It could also be worthwhile investing in a cloud service and having them manage our servers in the future.</p>
                <p>To minimize the risks of data extraction, only relevant information will be stored/accessed on user’s devices and not the entire database. In terms of database software, there are two main options, SQL Server (MS SQL) is a database service created by Microsoft and the other being MySQL, an open-source option owned by Oracle Corporation. At this point in the project, either option will suffice, with the main trade off being flexibility of MySQL’s open-source nature and SQL Servers’ security. Both software will be able to upscale with the project as it gets bigger. Cloud computing is becoming more efficient and useful for organizations, so considering this option would be ideal as the project matures and the need for having this service arises. There are great options for achieving this such as: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Oracle’s MySQL Cloud Service (for mySQL). As one of the team (Adrian) has previous, although limited, experience with using Oracle inventory database application in the past, we will opt to continue with mySQL. This can however be easily changed in the future if it is not wanted.</p>

                <p>With our finished ER Diagram we decided to address how we would protect our data. It became apparent that some of the information that we will be storing in the databases are private and confidential. This applies to both customer/user information but also the Plant species database that is owned by Green Thumb. After some research, we have come up with some potential strategies we can implement to secure our data, outlined below is our cybersecurity plan</p>
                <p>Databases contain lots of sensitive information, as far as the Green Thumb database is concerned some sensitive information will include: User’s shipping addresses, names and email addresses. The database will also have all the information and data relating to plant species and the relevant information pertaining to it. It would be easy for anyone with the appropriate skillset to access this information without the knowledge of Green Thumb and it’s users. The data leak can be damaging to both the organisation and it’s users.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of ways we can secure our databases. The potential security we can implement is Masking, Redaction and Encryption. We will also potentially implement a backup of the databases in the case of hardware malfunctions and system crashes.</p>
                <p>Masking is a strategy we can use to limit the amount of information that is visibly accessed. Information will appear as normal in the database, however some information will be substituted for “false” data or completely redacted. Similar to masking, redaction is the removal of visible information in a database. If the database cannot be read or if the sensitive information is covered up, it cannot be copied or stolen. Masking can be achieved in Database software such as MySQL.</p>
                <img src="images/masking.png" alt="" class="center">
                <p>Encryption converts the database into an unreadable format. If a user does not have the appropriate decryption key, it will not be readable. Encryption can be made possible through various applications, MySQL has some encryption capabilities, it is also possible to use other software such as Windows’ inbuilt encryption software BitLocker to encrypt the server the databases are located in. </p>
                <img src="images/encryption.png" alt="" class="center">
                <p>A database backup will be useful in the event that the original database is somehow compromised, destroyed or made un-accessible. With a backup you would be able to restore to previous versions of the database or restore the entire database when needed. This is made possible through software and services such as: ShadowProtect and Veeam, it is also possible to manage backups within MySQL. The management of backup systems could potentially be outsourced to other organizations.</p>
                <p>Accessibility of the database information can be limited within the organisation. Only authorised people can view certain sensitive information. The less accessible the data is, the less chance of a data breach. This can be done within database applications. In Green Thumb’s situation, MySQL provides appropriate tools to grant or restrict the access to the database to certain authorised users only.</p>

                <p>With IBM Watson Visual Recognition you are able to use a general pre-built model and then teach it using our own images and keyword classes. After uploading the pictures and selecting the relevant keywords detected in the images, you are given generated code snippets in various languages such as Java, Python and Ruby, to reference the various keywords in your code.</p>
                <p>The visual recognition tool will be used for identifying species and diagnosing diseases. If users are unsure of a plants’ exact species, all they have to do is take a photo and our visual recognition tool will identify species based on detections of leaf colour, shapes size etc. For diagnosis users will be able to simply take a photo and the visual recognition tool will observe any indicators of disease such as brown leaf spots or pests.</p>

              <p>The chatbot will be built using IBM Watson Assistant. The chatbot is built by creating ‘skills’ which use intents, entities and dialog to have a conversation with customers. An intent is how the bot understands and reads the customer questions.To create an intent, a range of similar questions that require similar answers are input and classified together. Entities hold the information that is used to answer questions and are collected within synonyms and definitions. The dialog is then created to act as a script for the chatbot to converse with customers. The dialog is triggered by intents and entities detected in a customer’s question. The chatbot then stores analytics from these customer interactions so that it can be constantly improved over time. </p>
              <img src="images/chatbot.png" alt="" class="center">
              <p><b>Machine Learning Model</b></p>
                <p>For the machine learning model we will be using IBM Watson Machine Learning. Here we will enter data curated by horticultural experts to teach the model our product specific information.  IBM Watson uses ‘transfer learning’ which enables machine learning to be executed and tailored quickly and easily. The transferred learning is a three layered model made up of:
                  <ol>
                    <li>General knowledge</li>
                    <li>Industry Specific Knowledge</li>
                    <li>Customer specific learning</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>These three layers enable IBM Watson to learn more from smaller sets of data and also ensures that your business data remains your own. The data is shared on a strict one-way path from bottom to top, meaning that any customer specific data is safe from being distributed.</p>
                <p>As per the feedback from assignment 2, we were advised to do some more research into machine learning and AI so we skipped ahead in our course modules to access appropriate learning materials. We learnt about decision trees for classification and supervised learning models. We decided that these were the appropriate machine learning strategies for Green Thumb as this would ensure we are using data from trusted horticultural resources, rather than random and possibly inaccurate data found on the internet. The first step of planning the AI strategy was to find the appropriate software for creating the various components required for the project. This actually began by looking into the visual recognition software, we looked at a range of different products such as Amazon Rekognition, Azure Custom Vision Google Cloud Vision and Classifai. Eventually we found IBM Watson Visual Recognition and decided that it was the most appropriate software to fit our project based on it being relatively easy to use.</p>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-1">What Stage Of The Plan Are We Up To?</h2>
          <p>ABRAIN has now reached the completion of assignment 3, and we are now handing this project onto the next team to bring it to market. At this stage, we have developed prototypes and strategies that align with each of our goals identified in the project aims. We have;
            <ol>
              <li>Engineered a working circuit board that can detect soil moisture levels</li>
              <li>Prototyped the user interface of the Green Thumb app</li>
              <li>Concepted the Green Thumb database and researched a strategy to protect our data</li>
              <li>Devised a strategy to build and deploy the Green Thumb AI</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The next steps for the soil probe is to engage with C#/C++ engineers who will make improvements to the prototypes. They can either source and build, or design and 3D print a rigid and waterproof housing for the Green Thumb Probe. Additionally if another team were to take over the project, the main things they would need to know regarding the tools and technology aspect would be the code for the D1 mini and how the interface of the Blynk app was set up including the authID which contains the key to the receiving value from the board over the WiFi.</p>
          <p>TThe user interface for the Green Thumb app has now been designed so the next logical step will be to develop the app. A software architect will be required to build the app within Swift and JAVA IDEs to ensure the app is compatible for both android and iOS devices. The software architect may use the UI prototype as a template, however, it is advisable that they engage with UI and UX specialists who can further develop the front-end to ensure a smooth user experience and streamlined design to further differentiate Green Thumb from its competitors. Additionally, the software architect will be required to build and secure the Green Thumb database using the mySQL code snippet and database ER diagram as a guide. </p>
          <p>The next steps for getting the Green Thumb AI deployed will be employing a Data Scientist or Machine-Learning Engineer. We have researched and selected the software that we want to use, therefore we would ideally be looking for someone with experience using IBM Studio and someone with expertise coding in Java or Python. We would also need to employ a horticulturalist to curate the data for the supervised machine learning model with accurate expert information on the plants. This is critical as the values entered into our system will need to be well researched in order for our product to be accurate and competitive. </p>
          <p>AAs the number of team members working on this project grows it will be necessary to educate staff on Cybersecurity to avoid phishing and similar attacks. More sophisticated Cybersecurity measures will need to be implemented as time goes by and new technology emerges. Consulting with cybersecurity professionals would be very beneficial in the future to avoid any new form of data breach and to periodically check up on systems to ensure they are uncompromised. Green Thumb’s data will become more and more valuable, as such, it would also be wise to consider hiring or setting up a backup of the servers and databases in case of a major hardware breach or failure. This will allow Green Thumb to keep operating even after a catastrophic event. </p>
          <p>Finally, once these technologies and systems are fully developed it will be essential to engage with marketing consultants to develop a plan to get Green Thumb on the market. The app will need to be hosted on both iOS and android app marketplaces and the soil probes will need to be made available for purchase through an e-commerce channel and related retailers such as Bunnings Warehouse and Flower Power. ABRAIN has worked hard to get this project to where it is now, we are putting our faith in your capable hands and cannot wait to see what becomes of Green Thumb. Good luck!</p>
