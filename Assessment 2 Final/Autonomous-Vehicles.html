                <p class="u-text u-text-1">Autonomous vehicles (AV) are vehicles that drive with varying degrees of human attention involved. AVs use control algorithms and GPS to plot and navigate their journey, avoiding hazards and mapping routes. In order for the cars to ‘see’, they use LIDAR technology, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging. The LIDAR uses narrow infrared laser pulses to scan and render oncoming objects. Autonomous vehicles have been classified into six levels of automation in a standard (J3016TM )by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) to better explain the varying degrees of development.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="u-text u-text-2">0. No automated features.<br>1. Driver assisting vehicles that can automate breaking and steering, however not simultaneously.<br>2. Semi-automated vehicles that can break and steer simultaneously but still require a human’s attention at all times<br>3. Conditionally automated vehicles in which drivers are able to temporarily take their eyes off the road<br>4. High level automated vehicles that essentially have full control, however still features a driving wheel and drivers seat<br>5. Fully automated vehicles with no steering wheel in which the car drives the human.
                </p>
                <p class="u-text u-text-3">‘The U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) uses J3016’s six levels of automation for on-road motor vehicles … and the document became a de facto global standard adopted by stakeholders in the automated vehicle technology.’ (SAE International, 2021, para. 4) <br>
                  <br>At the current forefront of this technology is the Tesla Autopilot. The present Autopilot model available is classified as a level 2 self-driving car, however, ‘All new Tesla cars come standard with advanced hardware capable of providing Autopilot features today, and full self-driving capabilities in the future—through software updates designed to improve functionality over time.’ (Tesla, 2021, Future of Driving) The Autopilot employs a range of safety features like automatic emergency braking and high-beams, front and side collision warnings.

                <p class="u-text u-text-4">Experts and developers predict that we will have relatively accessible level three automated vehicles within the decade, however high level automation will take several decades to develop safely. Apart from the technology itself, there are many other factors that push the development of higher level autonomous vehicles further into the future. Firstly, many roads and infrastructure do not have appropriate road lines and signage and are not well refined enough to support the vehicles. AV require clear and specific lines and signage in order for their sensors and LIDAR technology to safely navigate. Secondly, the cars would all need to be wirelessly connected to the traffic infrastructure as well as other vehicles to collect important information to safely navigate and to help minimise traffic congestion. Some companies such as Vovlo already use cloud-based services like their Sensus Connect to provide better navigation and a more comfortable, convenitent driving experience. Sensus Connect includes features like Park&amp;Pay, ‘Park&amp;Pay is the world-first integrated solution for finding and paying for parking from within your car. The application is based on car2infrastructure communication and points the way of new possibilities when the car starts to “communicate” with its surroundings.’ Eventually similar cloud-based technology will be used universally to connect cars to traffic infrastructure. Finally, laws would have to be discussed and made to cover liability for any accidents that do occur involving autonomous vehicles. For example, in the case of an accident, who is held accountable for the damage, the owner of the vehicle or the manufacturer? The National Transport Commission (NTC) of Australia already has a reform program that aims to implement laws to support the safe use of high-level autonomous vehicles on our roads. ‘Our reform program focuses on achieving national consistency. Our goal is end-to-end regulation to support the safe commercial deployment and operation of automated vehicles at all levels of automation in Australia.’ (National Transport Commission, 2018, Automated Vehicle Program) Until we have laws to police the potential accidents and issues involving AV, we cannot have them on our roads.<br>
                  <br>There are a lot of potential impacts that come with the development of this technology, both positive and negative. A self driving car gives commuters the opportunity to unlock more time for leisure or work and overall helps to increase productivity. Daily hours spent behind the wheel, stuck in traffic could now be used to catch up on work, tv shows or even sleep. The elimination of human error, replacing a driver with a system that has increased reaction time, acute attention to detail and cannot be distracted or impaired by external factors makes the road a much safer place to be. In a level 5 autonomous vehicle, time spent searching for a parking spot will be a thing of the past, passengers will simply be able to get dropped at their destination and the car will then proceed to park itself. The vehicle systems being connected and able to communicate with one another, along with traffic infrastructure, allows for reduced traffic jams and an overall smarter commute.<br>
                  <br>In contrast to these positive impacts, there are negative aspects to be considered. The convenience of this new technology comes at a rather large cost, with a multitude of jobs in many different industries being negatively affected ‘It is projected that globally there will be wide-scale redundancies among drivers in the trucking, taxi, ride-share, courier, and food-delivery industries, and workers in other related industries, such as warehousing and manufacturing, are also likely to be greatly affected.’ (Pettigrew, Fritschi &amp; Norman, August 2018, p.1) The financial cost of the extra hardware including sensors and cameras, along with the necessary software to run an autonomous vehicle will be costly and therefore car ownership is predicted to drastically decrease, with many opting to rent that cars when needed instead.<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-5">Personally, the development of this technology could drastically change my lifestyle, because I do not have a driver’s license, however, realistically I probably could not afford to make use of it. Theoretically it would save me lots of time, rather than catching public transport which means a lot of waiting and sometimes very indirect routes, I could be transported privately and directly to my destination. Being part of a more vulnerable demographic at night time as a female, it would make nights out a lot safer. Rather than using ride share apps or risking catching public transport alone, I could rely on the safety of a self-driving car taking me door to door.<br>
                  <br>The use of autonomous vehicles on our roads to some degree has already begun, with a wider, more common and higher-level use on the horizon within decades. These self-driving cars offer an inarguable convenience and an interesting solution to many current issues faced by commuters, however as a society we still have a long way to go in considering the moral, legal and technological challenges that we face in order to safely and thoughtfully execute this new technology.<br>
