                <blockquote class="u-text u-text-1"><b>Arvee</b>: "Thank you for Suwa Kuma for joining us today, hi." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "That's alright, Hello." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "In case anyone didn't know, Suwa is a Digital Channel Manager for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That is correct, right?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yes, that is correct." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "For this interview today we will ask him, several questions about this particular IT Industry that he is in."&nbsp;<br>
                  <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Our first Question is: Can you please tell us about your Job in the Commonwealth Bank, and what exactly you do there." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Sure, so I work in the Commonwealth Bank as a Digital Channel Manager, what that means is that I manage the Channel, the Digital Channel for transaction products and deposit products. We have quite a few digital channels in CBA that includes the commbank app, public website, we also have an online banking portal called netbank as well, we use an AI Chatbot called CEBA as well if you bank with commonwealth bank you would know. Also we are currently working on open banking as well, which is a new legislation that comes in. So these are the channels we kind of market up product? in CBA so those - basically delivering projects on those channels, that is what I would say my role is. <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Right, would you tell us a little bit more about that open banking and what makes that different from the normal things that you are doing?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yeah sure, open banking is legislation that came in, basically to allow customers to access their data in a more holistic way, you could be banking with Westpac and you could be banking with Commbank or you could be banking with a different bank as well but all your banking data is with each of those banking providers. Open banking is a government legislation, what it wants to do is bring all that data together so there is a "One Stop Shop" for the customer to get a view of all their banking information, so that could be transaction level or also customer level as well." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "OK, that makes sense. The next question would be: Could you describe the career progression that led you to this role, the Digital Channel Manager. Did you have to study or learn certain skills for that?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Sure, so I studied a Bachelor of Business and a Bachelor of Engineering in University but I studied Mechanical Engineering, but then my career has always been in finance, that is how I got into Commbank, but overtime in my previous roles I got the opportunity to work in various IT projects, so my skills and knowledge are learnt, so I never got any formal education in IT. I got to work with a lot of engineers and programers, and over time I have kind of progressed within the bank where I have been able to now work hand and glove with them, so that is how I would describe my career progression." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "If we have an estimate, let's say in years, how many years did it take you until you've learnt enough to get this role?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "So this role, I've been (in) for about 2 years a few months, I've been with the Bank for about six years, and over the six years I have been able to work on digital and IT projects as well. So I would say that's probably the amount of time it took me to get here, to develop those skills as well, but I am still learning." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Can you please tell us more about the industry that you work in?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Sure, so Commbank, it's the finance industry, it's the banking industry but we're specifically - I look after retail finance, so for everyday banking products, so a transaction account, or your debit card, or a savings account as well, so if you want to save for a travel fund for example, so those are the kind of products that I look after but specifically in the digital sphere." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Right, right. Which aspects from that work do you find the most challenging?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "The most challenging aspect of the work is I guess understanding or knowing what customers want. We have a good grasp of what we think customers want and how they bank with us, based on a lot of the data we have but sometimes it's not always right, sometimes we could fall short as well. So in CBA we have what we call a very agile project delivery, so we may deliver a new technology or a new platform but then we are constantly reiterating on that and constantly building on that to refine it, optimize it and make it better for customers." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "When you're dealing with, lets say, the older generation, in that kind of sense, how is it challenging for you guys?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Suwa</b>: "We do find that a lot of the younger generation are more digitally active, so they tend to use the commbank app and online banking portals to engage with us, generally the older generation prefers the more traditional method of banking so they prefer to go face to face, talk to someone over the phone so it is challenging. There is a lot of "hand holding" that needs to be done with the older generation to walk them through digital platforms and also when we build new technology, we have to keep that in the back of our mind, that we're not just building functions for the younger generation, who are quite good digitally and in tech as well, but there is another generation that we need to consider as well, so considering all customers." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Aside from those things, is there anything else, or other kinds of work that you do in the Commonwealth Bank?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "So the main - much of my work is around project delivery in the tech world, in digital, but I do also look after a lot of the competitor analysis as well, so what is Westpac doing? What are the neo banks doing? What is happening in the International Market? What are some of the banks like HSBC or CDE for example what are they all doing and what are the new cool functionalities they are introducing? Also looking at the new emerging trends and technology like blockchain, AI, machine learning for examples, how can we bring that into CBA so we're constantly moving forward as a bank." <br><b>Arvee</b>:"What aspect of your work do you spend most of your time on? Please tell us about these." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Most time, as I said, is mainly project delivery, so it's throughout the project life cycle, I manage multiple projects at a given time. It could be at one stage where I'm giving requirements to developers and engineers and how we want a specific function to be. There might be another project at the same time where we have just gone live to customers and we're getting data and insights, measuring whether we met the customer needs that we wanted or what we planned for. So throughout the journey of the project. At the start, coming up with requirements and then going back and building the actual product and then delivering and once you deliver then analysing how it's done. And if it doesn't meet the needs, then going back to the drawing board and then improving on the initial design." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Is there any challenge on that, besides from what you have already told us, or does everything go smoothly?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "No, you always have to plan for the worst. The biggest challenges for us are cost and timing. Always when you plan something, you're always very optimistic, you're given a certain amount of money so you can get it done within this amount of money. But then when you actually start building it, you realize that there's a lot of complexities, which CBA are quite a old bank we're one of the oldest banks in Australia there's a lot of legacy platforms and a lot of legacy systems that all our new functions need to integrate with, and that can cost a lot of money and can take a lot of time and manpower to build those things. Those are the biggest hurdles that we face in the bank at the moment." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Tell us more about your interactions with the other IT professionals you interact with." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "So most of the IT professionals are like engineers or programmers, if it's within digital platforms in front end, we also work with what we call product owners and scrum masters that keep the developers going, they give them requirements and building things. If there's back end changes, we have expert architects and also engineers as well who've been with the bank for quite some time, they understand how the different systems work. So in terms of interaction, those are the people that I interact with mostly but it could be again, throughout the life cycle of the project, at the start of the project we give requirements on how we want something to be, then we work in what we call sprints, so in agile projects, so sprints every two weeks we catch up again to see how things have progressed, we get a demo of how things look, and then we, throughout the project life cycle keep in touch, and if there's any issues around funding or budgeting or prioritization, we have that conversation as well and we do what we call backlog prioritization. If we put something new comes in we put it in the backlog and we prioritize it across all the other different tasks that need to be done, and then we go live with the product, and when we go live with the product we gather data on how things are going and if we're meeting the customers needs." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "So we got customers, we got the engineers, the architects and the digital side where we have those people. Aside from them, like administrators or someone similar, do you have any other people you interact with in work?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yeah, definitely. We work alot with legal representatives, compliance teams who look out, who make sure that the information we're providing is correct and the functionalities meet the customers needs. We also work with marketing teams, CBA's quite a large bank so we have our own in house analytics teams as well who gather the data and give insights. So, yeah a whole host of stakeholders, we work with."&nbsp;<br><b>Arvee</b>: "How about your interactions with clients or investors, in that case?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "My interactions are very minimal in my space, personally. With clients and investors, generally any enquiries come as a complaint or as a feedback what we do is investigate, for example, if there's a defect in one of our platforms our technology then we would go and investigate what the issue was and then if there's any sort of remediation that needs to happen then we might refund the customer or any other kind of remediation as well. At the start of the project we do a lot of customer research, so we have a lot of focus groups, research workshops where we do a demo, functionality or a platform and we take it outside with a small group of customers just to test it out and see what their feedback is and based on that feedback then we would go on and build the actual product." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "For asking for feedback do you have a controlled group of people who you do that with, or is it all random?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "As in who is asking the questions or?" <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Yes, to get your feedback from." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yeah so we have a dedicated user experience team and there's researchers as well that are good at gathering information from customers. From the customer's side if we do want to test out certain functions we might want to keep it specific to certain groups of people to see how that works. For example if we want to test the older customers then we would ask certain older customers to come in and test with us - " <br><b>Arvee</b>: "So pretty much, it depends on the situation that you're currently looking for research on." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "So for our final main question: Can you share with us a good example of the work you do that best captures the essence of your IT Industry?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yeah, sure. For me the IT Industry, the essence of IT Industry is building new technology or new services that help customers meet their needs or solving customers problems, it doesn't even have to be in a "for profit" sense, it could be for a "non profit" sense as well. But some of the works that I done - one of my favourite works was: I was involved in a project where I built a calendaring system and a video conferencing system as well, so if you are looking for a home loan and say you live overseas at the moment or you're travelling at the moment and you want to speak to someone about getting a home loan, what the system did is it will allow you to book an appointment with a lender and you can speak to them through video conferencing, through our digital platforms, it will make it seamless through the app which is a few clicks and you can straightaway talk to someone face to face. You might even be living in rural Australia and you can't come into a branch, you could also book an appointment at a shopping centre or a cafe that's close by to you and a lender will come to you and talk to you about your home loan needs. So that was a good piece of technology that I delivered that I think does capture the essence of IT. <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Right, that's a very wonderful answer, thank you very much Suwa. Is there anyone else from the group who has any questions for Suwa?" <br>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "In your Industry or in your Job field, what are the main resources that you use?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Resources as in the technology we use to communicate internally or?" <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "As in what technology, yes" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "So we use Microsoft Teams and Atlassian's Jira and Confluence. So Jira is the product management suite that we use to write down users' stories and keep track of all the different deliverables in a project." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "So would you describe your job as a developer?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "No, so we have developers. I am not a developer myself. We have engineers and developers who do the work but I work very closely with them in terms of giving requirements and making sure that the work that they've done is meeting the business priorities that we've set up. <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "Since you said you work really close with developers, what do you think is important for a developer, what strengths are important for a developer?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "That's a very good question, in my experience, almost every developer I have come across is technically gifted and they're knowledgeable, they know what they're doing but there are few out of that group who can translate business priorities and business outcomes and also customer needs as well and then translate that better I suppose. So that's another added bonus skill that will be beneficial for any sort of developer, so everyones very good at it technically but there are other skills that. Does that answer your question?" <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "Yeah. I would think that communication is one of the really important aspects of your job" - <br><b>Suwa</b>: - "Yeah, definitely" <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "Since everything is starting to be automated, how do you think the technology that you use will change in the future?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "A lot of the functions in banking, at least in terms of internally may not exist, in the future a lot of our data management tools will be automated, so we may not need frontline staff in a call centre to answer all of the questions that customers may have. We have a chatbot, it's still not as intelligent as we have forecast, but over time through machine learning and AI technology, those jobs could go away. You could be soon be just dealing purely with a machine that's handling all your queries and questions." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "I have one last question: How do you manage your work/life balance? In regards to tight deadlines and that kind of stuff." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yes, very good question. Prioritization. So always having a goal on what you're trying to achieve and what you're business priorities are, and being very strict in that so if there's any piece of work that you're doing that doesn't meet that, then you have to have a very honest conversation with your team, with the developers to see if it's actually doing what we want - are we actually doing what we wanted to do? And if it doesn't, if the answer is no, then you de-prioritize it and you focus on something else and there might be things that come in left field that might need your urgent attention at that time, but again everytime theres more work load that comes in you have to be honest with yourself, you're only working a certain amount of hours in a day, there's only so much time you can give to each of those work, so you have to effectively prioritize each of the tasks." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "Were you part of any lead roles in any of your jobs or projects." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "What do you mean by lead roles?" <br>
                  <span style="font-style: normal;"><b style="">Nikhil</b>: "As you said you're a manager now, kind of like team leaders, have you been leading something?" <br>
                  </span><b>Suwa</b>: "The leadership area comes in more from the product side, so as a product owner, I am a product owner in a lot of those projects, what would happen is: we'll be given a certain set of requirements from the business that needs to be done, and it's my job to make sure that the engineers are building the technology the way it should be or designing things the way we think the customers would want it to be. So that's where the leadership comes in, but within the team itself there are technical leads who do a lot of the work. I'm not the one who is coding and doing all the technical work but I'm giving guidelines, so that's where the leadership comes in." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "So you're still managing the team and controlling, not controlling, telling them what to do and how to do it." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yeah, and it's a two way street as well, they will come back saying: This is not something we can get done within the time frames or within the budget that you've given us, we need more money, can you go and get us more money? And then it's my job then to go back to senior leadership and our stakeholders, and have that conversation." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "Is it difficult to manage your team?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "I wouldn't say it's difficult, over time you build the skills and the relationships, so we understand each other, but initially when I started in the role, I didn't have the technical knowledge, I didn't study IT in University so there was a bit of difficulty in terms of understanding the terminology and the language and how everything fitted in with each other, but then over time I was able to grasp them and work more efficiently." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "You said you were different initially, not as you are right now, how did you improve, what are the qualities of a successful team leader or project leader?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Being able to listen and being able to accept that sometimes you don't know the answer and you may have to rely on other people, especially when you don't have the technical knowledge of everything and there are people in the bank, developers and engineers that have been there for years, who've done it for years. Sometimes you have to let them be independent and take their guidance as well, and that's where I've learnt a lot of my skills and a lot of my knowledge through them. Asking questions as well, if you don't understand something, not being afraid to ask a question: How does this work? Hey can we catch up for coffee? Can you tell me how this API works? You have this architectural diagram, can you tell me how all of these fit with each other? So asking questions and always trusting the engineers and developers as well." <br><b>Nikhil</b>: "That was really informative, that was all the questions from me." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Cool, great questions. Thank you." <br>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Renee</b>: "I have a quick question, do you find it difficult working in an industry where everything is moving and developing so fast? Do you ever feel stressed keeping up with trends? I think you mentioned watching what other banks are doing, does it feel like you're on the edge of stuff a lot?" <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Yeah, in many ways, yeah. That's part of my job. It is what it is, it's just one of those jobs that you have to constantly be innovating and constantly pushing the boundaries. You can't be the kodak, where you sat back and let everyone else move forward, and you've just sat on your laurels thinking that the products you offer are great, customers are always going to love you, that's not the case. You have to be constantly evolving and innovating, but the CBA as a bank is quite big and quite resourceful so we've got a lot of staff who do a lot of that stuff, the research and the analysis and picking new emerging technology and how to integrate with our platforms as well." <br><b>Renee</b>: "Thank you." <br>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Idris</b>: "Alright, I have a question. Has the company had any security breaches or information issues or anything related to your employees or customers forgetting their passwords." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Cyber Security is a big part of our technology teams, we have a dedicated cyber security team who kind of give fraud alerts etc. so we're constantly monitoring for financial crimes, identity take overs etc. and also even regular things like forgetting your password for example those are all things we consider when we build a lot of our platforms and a lot of our technology. We assume our customers are going to forget their passwords, or there's a chance that a customer's identity could be taken over or there could be fraudsters trying to mimic that they're someone else, so all kinds of things, so cyber security is a big part of our bank's remit. Does that answer your question? It looks like you've still got a bit more questions there." <br><b>Idris</b>: "Yeah, I'm fine." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "That's ok, which part of the question did you want clarified?" <br><b>Idris</b>: "I suppose I wanted to ask a bit more how they handle, over the phone I suppose - verification." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "How they handle over the phone verification?" <br><b>Idris</b>: "Yeah, when it comes to accessing sensitive information." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "So some of this information I'm not allowed to disclose, and how and what kind of data we use to verify, but normally the staff member would have certain predetermined data fields that they would confirm with the customer. General ones are your name and date of birth, that is something that they would confirm, but that's used across all industries, but there are other criteria we use as well to verify who you say you are. If you are someone who is digitally active we may use some of your digital data that you use, but if you're not someone who is active digitally there maybe predetermined code words or passwords you may have told the bank, and that's something the branch staff would ask, or the phone staff would confirm with you to verify your identity." <br><b>Idris</b>: "Alright then, that's all I have to ask." <br>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Arvee</b>: "Alright, I guess that's all of our questions for today, thank you very much Suwa for taking your time to do this interview for us." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "That's alright." <br><b>Arvee</b>: "We all learnt new things about your IT Industry, and we look forward to implementing that for our assessments." <br><b>Suwa</b>: "Thank you for all the great questions, this was very insightful to me as well, all the best with your course and your assignments as well."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Interview Reflection</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">When considering a career in IT, finance and banking are not necessarily the industries that one would expect to to find work within. Our interview with Suwa was eye opening and gave us a strong understanding of the far reaching applications of IT across any industry. <br>
          <br>Suwa’s role is centred around project management and delivery, which is an important skill for us to build upon if we wish to seek a career in IT. At Commonwealth bank, an agile project management approach is employed meaning that when they deliver a project, such as a new app function, the work does not stop at launch. Rather, they continue to reiterate and are constantly working to optimize the tool. This agile project delivery method is a common process in IT related projects, so it was interesting to learn more about the process and how we can build our skills in this area. <br>
          <br>Suwa helped us to understand that when building new technology, it is important to consider people from all walks of life. When working on our project idea in assignment 3, we should consider how the technology would be received by different audiences - younger, older etc. Suwa emphasised the importance of getting feedback from your audience, so this is a tool we will use to optimize our project idea in assignment 3. <br>
          <br>Suwa described the essence of the IT Industry as using technology to help people solve problems. It was incredibly interesting to learn about how Commonwealth Bank has used technology to enhance the customer experience and solve their pain points. He has left us with a newfound sense of curiosity into how we can use technology to solve problems across all industries and areas of the globe.
