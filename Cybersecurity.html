                <p class="u-text u-text-1">What Cyber Security does is that it considers the measures to prevent or to protect against cyber-criminals and unauthorized use of any electronic data. Cyber Security is a bit broad term, but it can be divided into smaller categories such as Network Security, Information Security or Security Frameworks. <br>
                  <br>An example of a common, but useful technology under this section that most people from Cybersecurity (and any other data-conscious people) uses can prevent malicious files from being downloaded and executed to cause damage to other computers, or opening a backdoor for hackers to gain unauthorised access to the user’s or company’s computers or database is an antivirus. <br>
                  <br>Antivirus softwares has been around since the 1980s around the occurrence of the first computer virus to exist being the Brain virus, created by two brothers in Pakistan. The reason behind the creation of the virus was to teach consumers a lesson for creating and purchasing illegal copies of softwares, which the virus spread worldwide. The virus included the creator’s names, copyright, email  and address for the users to contact for help (1). The payload of the virus would hide itself within the computer’s memory infecting files on the system by increasing their file size after being executed while the virus ran in the background. This would then lead to the hard disk in the computer or floppy disk inserted in the floppy drive to slow down as the storage filled up. <br>
                  <br>Antivirus software developers have to constantly update their databases with new instances of virus, malware and worms discovered by the users with anonymous tracking on the software, which allows the developers to learn more about the virus and malware in order to gain a step ahead of their creators (2). New features are also implemented that can prevent hackers from gaining unauthorised access to your computer, to compromising a company’s database, and a ransomware attack that can infect multiple computers on a network to potentially spread to other computers around the globe. <br>
                  <br>Antivirus softwares today are bundled with new features such as a virtual private network (VPN), a separate operating system to boot into which allows the user to remove the virus’ files manually to minimise its destruction, a separate browser tied to its the antivirus software, anti spyware features that prevents hackers from gaining access to the users’ webcam or keylogging inputs, a browser addon incase the user prefers to use a third party browser, to detect a website with potential malicious content or phishing and more to list. Some antivirus softwares also include a password vault with a password generator feature that allows the users to keep their passwords different from the other accounts they have. This allows the user to only remember one password which accesses the password vault. <br>
                  <br>To sum up, Cybersecurity is our fail-safe plan to protect from any cyber attacks-- whether it may be stealing or manipulation of data. Through CS, it makes the Internet continue to be a safe environment for all people, for the business present online, and protects any information you store on the web. As hackings and online distributions are increasing as modern time passes, cybersecurity is getting essential thus, any technology that aids helping to prevent and resolve it is as important, just like antiviruses (Brujin; Janssen, 2017). There are also cybersecurity technologies in workplaces that are more advanced than consumer grade technologies, so that incidents are dealt faster and better. With companies having high level encryption on their servers and databases, proprietary virtual private networks for laptops provided to its workers, or pin number generators for a more secure login to work, are just a few examples of how Cybersecurity works. <br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-2">Interestingly, unlike other areas of IT, the technology related to Cyber Security develops alongside the technology used by Malicious Individuals and organisations. The technology is constantly changing and evolving. <br>
                  <br>Even though there are developments in cyber security, we can never actually say that we are “safe.” For example, security software such as Anti Virus applications can only detect what is already known, although this may be good enough to protect systems at the present, newly created Malicious software can possibly break through those applications and cause all sorts of trouble, therefore Security software will always evolve to include more and more potential risks to their databases. <br>
                  <br>There are many potential dangers and impacts of Cyber Security breaches for anyone, from large corporations down to individuals. In 2012 the popular service LinkedIn had a data breach that compromised nearly 6.5 million encrypted passwords (Velazco, C., 2012). <br>
                  <br>Unfortunately the most vulnerable demographic of people that are most affected by cyber crime is the elderly generation as they have limited experience and education about recent technological advancements (Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center IC3, 2018). They are often targeted by Phishing Scams from both online and via telephone, usually to steal money or identity; amongst other types of cyber crime. <br>
                  <br>Changes will hopefully be made in terms of education on Cyber Security and educating users. New applications are being made available such as Virtual Private Networks, Anti Virus and encrypted messaging applications. Upgrades and updates to existing applications, systems, networks and technologies will also likely happen to create a safer digital environment. <br>
                  <br>Due to the nature of Cyber Security and new, and potentially dangerous cyber threats, there is a demand for Cyber Security Professionals. According to an article written on Seek “the ACSC found 90% of Australian organisations faced some form of attempted or successful cyber security compromise during 2015-16.” (Niesche, C., n.d.)<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-3">In this current era a lot of daily life is now conducted through electronics; messaging, banking and various types of work related data are all stored electronically. Friends, family members and ourselves check our inbox for electronic mail which might contain sensitive information. Most of us check and use social media to share pictures amongst other things, in fact in 2020 3.6 Billion people used social media according to Statista (Tankovska, H., 2021) and 3.9 Billion according to backlinko (Dean, B., 2021). <br>
                  <br>Many people we know shop online and when they buy items in store, many of them will opt to use EFTPOS (Electronic funds transfer at point of sale.) <br>
                  <br>As it is now extremely difficult not to use any form of electronic service, a lot of our personal information and data is on the internet whether we like it or not. Unfortunately, as it is in the physical world, there are many individuals and organisations that have malicious intent. These individuals and organizations create what is known as cyber threats which can exploit many different areas. Some are after information, some are there to try and steal money. There are many ways and strategies these people use to achieve such exploits, many use Malware (malicious software) and many others use scams. According to the ACSC Annual Cyber Threat Report July 2019 to June 2020,  the Australian Cyber Security Centre responded to 2,266 cyber security incidents during that time (Australian Cyber Security Centre, 2021). <br>
                  <br>Caution must be used when engaging in electronic activities especially when online as seemingly inconsequential decisions can lead to severe outcomes for users. Thankfully for users like ourselves, our families and friends there are many products offered that may improve our safety and security in cyberspace such as Virtual Private Networks, Security Applications and encrypted messaging services such as Signal. Additionally there are organizations like the Australian Cyber Security Centre that can assist in education and instruction on Cyber security and Cyber threats. <br>
